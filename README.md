Response to reviewers
We are grateful to the editor and all the reviewers for the time they spent making their constructive comments and useful suggestions, which significantly improved the quality of our manuscript. We carefully incorporated and considered each suggested revision and comment brought forward by the reviewers. Below, we provide our response point by point to the reviewers’ comments, along with the corresponding revisions we have made, indicated in red.

Reviewer #1 

Reviewer #1, Concern #1: The paper is well written and clearly defines the objectives. Carry out a study of advantages and disadvantages and make an innovative proposal. I agree with the disadvantages raised by you in the conclusions but in my opinion, you leave the problem open without a proposal, this should be resolved even if it is an initial proposal.  

Author response: We greatly appreciate your valuable suggestions. For the disadvantages of our model, we have proposed the corresponding limitations and provided a preliminary feasible solution in the revised manuscript. We can consider utilizing the Diffusion probabilistic model [48-50] to reduce noise and enhance the generation capabilities, as well as employing the knowledge distillation method [51, 52] to address the problems of running time and application limitations. (the second paragraph of Section 5.3 Discussion)
